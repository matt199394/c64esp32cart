Inspired on  chat64 cart by Bart Venneker and Theo van den Beld, same hardware with some midifications:
- SD card
- 27C512 EEPROM
- add jumpers to select 8k memory inside EEPROM
- add transistor to control EXROM line
- standart or ultiMax mode jumper
  
 About the code:
  The arduino skeck and ACME assembly code are a working progress, there are many bugs to fix, expecialy SD directory code.
  Not all SIDs file are playable, same as PRG file.
Feaures:
- Run PRG file
- play SID files and show SID info
- show koala images
- show current time
- show current weather
- show news by using 2x2 charset
  
Any help is appreciate,
Have fun!

Matteo
